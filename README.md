i3lock - improved screen locker
===============================
[i3lock](https://i3wm.org/i3lock/)> is a simple screen locker like slock.
After starting it, you will see a white screen (you can configure the
color/an image). You can return to your screen by entering your password.

Many little improvements have been made to i3lock over time:

- i3lock forks, so you can combine it with an alias to suspend to RAM
  (run "i3lock && echo mem > /sys/power/state" to get a locked screen
   after waking up your computer from suspend to RAM)

- You can specify either a background color or a PNG image which will be
  displayed while your screen is locked. Note that i3lock is not an image
manipulation software. If you need to resize the image to fill the screen
or similar, use existing tooling to do this before passing it to i3lock.

- You can specify whether i3lock should bell upon a wrong password.

- i3lock uses PAM and therefore is compatible with LDAP etc.
  On OpenBSD i3lock uses the bsd_auth(3) framework.

Install
-------

See [the i3lock home page](https://i3wm.org/i3lock/).

Requirements
------------
- pkg-config
- libxcb
- libxcb-util
- libpam-dev
- libcairo-dev
- libxcb-xinerama
- libxcb-randr
- libev
- libx11-dev

Running i3lock
-------------
Simply invoke the 'i3lock' command. To get out of it, enter your password and
press enter.

On OpenBSD the `i3lock` binary needs to be setgid `auth` to call the
authentication helpers, e.g. `/usr/libexec/auth/login_passwd`.

Building i3lock
---------------
We recommend you use the provided package from your distribution. Do not build
i3lock unless you have a reason to do so.

First install the dependencies listed in requirements section, then run these
commands (might need to be adapted to your OS):
```
autoreconf --force --install

rm -rf build/
mkdir -p build && cd build/

../configure \
  --prefix=/usr \
  --sysconfdir=/etc \
  --disable-sanitizers

make
```
