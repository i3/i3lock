i3lock - improved screen locker
===============================
i3lock is a simple screen locker like slock. After starting it, you will
see a white screen (you can configure the color/an image). You can return
to your screen by entering your password.

Many little improvements have been made to i3lock over time:

- i3lock forks, so you can combine it with an alias to suspend to RAM
  (run "i3lock && echo mem > /sys/power/state" to get a locked screen
   after waking up your computer from suspend to RAM)

- You can specify either a background color or a PNG image which will be
  displayed while your screen is locked.

- You can specify whether i3lock should bell upon a wrong password.

- You can specify i3lock to logout from any TTYs

- You can run any password-failure script

- You can lock/unlock screen using control socket, if i3lock runs as daemon.
  This feature allow you to lock screen and ttys plug-in (unlock) or plug-out (lock) any device trough USB using UDEV-RULES see z99-lockscreen.rules-example

- i3lock uses PAM and therefore is compatible with LDAP etc.
