2014-07-18 i3lock 2.6

 • NEW DEPENDENCY: use libxkbcommon-x11 instead of libX11
   This helps us get rid of all code that directly uses libX11
 • Use cairo_status_to_string for descriptive errors.
 • Add `-e` option to not validate empty password.
 • Bugfix: update the initial keyboard modifier state (Thanks lee, Ran)
 • Re-raise i3lock when obscured in a separate process
 • Turn on the screen on successful authentication
 • Delay to turn off the screen after wrong passwd
 • Discard half-entered passwd after some inactivity
 • Ignore empty passwd after repeated Enter keypress
 • Scale the unlock indicator (for retina displays)

2013-06-09 i3lock 2.5

 • NEW DEPENDENCY: Use libxkbcommon for input handling
   This makes input handling much better for many edge cases.
 • Bugfix: fix argument parsing on ARM (s/char/int/)

 • Bugfix: Use ev_loop_fork after fork, fixes forking on kqueue based OSes
 • Bugfix: Fix centering the indicator in the no-xinerama case
 • Only use mlock() on Linux, FreeBSD (for example) requires root
 • promote the "could not load image" message from debug to normal
 • s/pam_message/pam_response/ (Thanks Tucos)

 • Allow XKB_KEY_XF86ScreenSaver as synonym for enter
   This keysym is generated on convertible tablets by pressing a hardware
   lock/unlock button.
 • Allow passwordless PAM conversations (e.g. fingerprint)
 • Add ctrl+u password reset
 • Set window name to i3lock

2012-06-02 i3lock 2.4.1

  • Bugfix: Copy the color depth from parent (root) window instead of
    hardcoding a depth of 24

2011-11-06 i3lock 2.2

  • Don’t re-grab pointer/keyboard on MappingNotify. In some rare situations,
    this lead to some keypresses "slipping through" to the last focused window.
  • Correctly handle Mode_switch/ISO_Level3_Shift
  • Render to a pixmap which is used as background for the window instead of
    copying contents on every expose event
