2015-05-20 i3lock 2.7

 • Die when the X11 connection breaks during runtime (Thanks Eduan)
 • Implement logging the number of failed attempts (Thanks koebi)
 • Ignore password validation is pam is in wrong state (Thanks Neodyblue)
 • Get current user with getpwuid() instead of using $ENV{USER} (Thanks Martin)
 • Add support for Compose and dead-keys with libxkbcommon.
   Requires libxkbcommon ≥ 0.5.0 (Thanks Daniel)
 • Format the source using clang-format.
 • Refresh pam credentials on successful authentication (for Kerberos and the
   like) (Thanks James)
 • List pressed modifiers on failed authentication (Thanks Deiz, Alexandre)
 • Only redraw the screen if the unlock indicator is actually used
   (Thanks Ingo)
 • Make pkg-config configurable for cross-compilation (Thanks Nikolay)

2014-07-18 i3lock 2.6

 • NEW DEPENDENCY: use libxkbcommon-x11 instead of libX11
   This helps us get rid of all code that directly uses libX11
 • Use cairo_status_to_string for descriptive errors.
 • Add `-e` option to not validate empty password.
 • Bugfix: update the initial keyboard modifier state (Thanks lee, Ran)
 • Re-raise i3lock when obscured in a separate process
 • Turn on the screen on successful authentication
 • Delay to turn off the screen after wrong passwd
 • Discard half-entered passwd after some inactivity
 • Ignore empty passwd after repeated Enter keypress
 • Scale the unlock indicator (for retina displays)

2013-06-09 i3lock 2.5

 • NEW DEPENDENCY: Use libxkbcommon for input handling
   This makes input handling much better for many edge cases.
 • Bugfix: fix argument parsing on ARM (s/char/int/)
 • Bugfix: free(reply) to avoid memory leak
 • Bugfix: Use ev_loop_fork after fork, fixes forking on kqueue based OSes
 • Bugfix: Fix centering the indicator in the no-xinerama case
 • Only use mlock() on Linux, FreeBSD (for example) requires root
 • promote the "could not load image" message from debug to normal
 • s/pam_message/pam_response/ (Thanks Tucos)
 • remove support for NOLIBCAIRO, cairo-xcb is widespread by now
 • Allow XKB_KEY_XF86ScreenSaver as synonym for enter
   This keysym is generated on convertible tablets by pressing a hardware
   lock/unlock button.
 • Allow passwordless PAM conversations (e.g. fingerprint)
 • Add ctrl+u password reset
 • Set window name to i3lock

2012-06-02 i3lock 2.4.1

 • Bugfix: Correctly center unlock indicator after reconfiguring screens
   (Thanks xeen)
 • Bugfix: Revert shift lock handling (broke uppercase letters)
 • Bugfix: Skip shift when getting the modifier mask (Thanks SardemFF7)

2012-04-01 i3lock 2.4

 • Bugfix: Fix background color when using cairo (Thanks Pascal)
 • Only output text when in debug mode (fixes problems with xautolock)
 • fallback when the image cannot be loaded
 • Use (void) instead of () for functions without args (Thanks fernandotcl)

2012-03-15 i3lock 2.3.1

 • Fix compilation on some systems

2012-03-15 i3lock 2.3

  • Implement a visual unlock indicator
  • Support ISO_Level5_Shift and Caps Lock
  • Lock the password buffer in memory, clear it in RAM after verifying
  • Fork after the window is visible, not before
  • Bugfix: Copy the color depth from parent (root) window instead of
    hardcoding a depth of 24

2011-11-06 i3lock 2.2

  • Don’t re-grab pointer/keyboard on MappingNotify. In some rare situations,
    this lead to some keypresses "slipping through" to the last focused window.
  • Correctly handle Mode_switch/ISO_Level3_Shift
  • Render to a pixmap which is used as background for the window instead of
    copying contents on every expose event
  • Handle screen resolution changes while screen is locked
  • Manpage: document arguments for every option

  • Accept return/backspace when the buffer of 512 bytes is full
  • Handle numpad keys correctly
